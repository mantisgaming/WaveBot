# WaveBot

Created by Max Allen &copy;2024

Wave bot is a discord bot that will react with a waving emoji to any system welcome messages welcoming new users to a discord server. This removes the spam from stickers while keeping community engagement with new users.

To invite WaveBot to a discord server, click the following link:
[Invite WaveBot (https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1120903508078633020)](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1120903508078633020)

## Notes

For anyone interested in building and hosting their own instance, there is currently some error about a duplicate typescript definition that needs to be resolved by deleting the duplicate definition in the discord.js library.
